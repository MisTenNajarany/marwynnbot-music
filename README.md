# MarwynnBot Music <img align="right" src="/vibingtoad.jpg" height="100" width="100">

I am a port of [MarwynnBot's](https://github.com/marwynnsomridhivej/marwynnbot) music functionality.

## Add Me To Your Server

## Prefix

* The default prefix is `m?`
* Global prefixes are mentioning the bot or `mm` *(case insensitive)*

## Commands

![progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-100%25-orange)

Add the bot and do `m?help` for a list of all supported commands.

Commands are separated into categories that determine a command's function. I am currently working on making a website
that will display all of MarwynnBot Music's commands. Please stay tuned for its release

For a guide on all commands and their usages, I will be updating [MarwynnBot's Website](http://www.marwynnbot.tk)

## Self Hosting

I would prefer that you do not create an instance of my bot for self hosting purposes. I have made this repository
public so that anyone who needs an example of a bot written in discord.py can freely look at how I have made it. I do
realise that my python is garbage, and I am working on improving as this project is developed.
